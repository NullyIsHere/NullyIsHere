# Hey, I’m NullyIsHere :D 🎉🤘

This is my quiet spot on GitHub, where I’m all about building harder, better, faster, stronger in Python 🐍⚡. Around here, I’m always up all night to get lucky with some cryptography 🔐✨ and AI 🤖🧠 experiments.

## 👀 What’s on my watchlist? 👀

- **[february](https://github.com/NullyIsHere/february)** – Image proxy 🖼️🪄. (Work it, code it, process it, frame it.)
- **[unifier](https://github.com/Unifier/unifier)** – A cross-server and cross-platform bridge bot that works just as fast as you can type 🚀💬 (One more time? Always. 🔁)
- **Custom VPN Protocol (WIP)** – Cooking up my own protocol because “good enough” isn’t good enough 🛠️🌐.

I’m always experimenting, learning, and chasing that “no-need-to-debug” moment 🤯🚫🐞. Here to build, break, and reimagine—at my own speed (which people say is too fast, idk why 🏎️💨), with a little robot rock on the side 🤖🎸.

🪩 Emojis, more emojis, always more emojis! 🥳🔥✨
*Are there enough emojis?*
